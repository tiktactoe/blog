# Tik Tac Toe Project

## Hack day: TicTacToe challenge

### Tic Tac toe challenge!

Create a Tic Tac Toe program where two users face together a dual of 'X's' and 'O's using [Pascal Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)).

#### Description

With a 3x3 grid, the main goal is to succeed in placing three marks horizontally, vertically or diagonal. Who ever makes the three marks in any of this positions without being interrupted by the second player is the winner.

Every player has one turn and then the second player hits with its mark.

Let the best player win!


## How to run the code!

If you want to play the game, go to [onlinegdb](https://www.onlinegdb.com/) and choose Pascal language for compilation. Open `tictactoe.pas` file and copy paste the code and run it!  Enjoy while you play against a random algorithm that will give you random numbers from the empty grid spaces.
