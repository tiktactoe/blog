# How to write a Tic Tac Toe in Pascal?

Pascal is an imperative high-level procedural programming language. It was design by [Niklaus Wirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth) released in 1970. It was developed following the pattern structure of [ALGOL 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60) language.

ALGOL was developed with a main goal, describe algorithms. So Pascal had explicit goals that would be efficient using a compiler and in runtime and, of course, allow developers to have a well-structured program.
