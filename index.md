# How to write a Tic Tac Toe in Pascal?

Pascal is an imperative high-level procedural programming language. It was design by [Niklaus Wirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth) released in 1970. It was developed following the pattern structure of [ALGOL 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60) language.

ALGOL was developed with a main goal, to describe algorithms. Pascal had more explicit goals, to be efficient with a compiler and when running a program. It also allowed developers to have a well-structured program.

Follow the images below and you will see how the program works. There are two players, User1 and User 2. When User1 gives a position number from 1 to 9, following a matrix form, an 'X' will be placed in that position. Then User2 gives its position and a 'O' will placed instead. If any of the users gives the same position as the other user, the program won't let the user place any position and will prompt the user to give another number.
